  "about": {
    "intro": "I'm a full stack engineer with 4+ years working on B2B and B2C SaaS platforms across industries like govtech (Saudi), HRtech, travel, health, and telematics. I excel in creating backend architectures, integrating systems, managing deployments and monitoring — as well as crafting frontends enriched with user analytics and CMS-powered content.",
    "currentWork": "Currently working on SetupInSaudi — a compliance-first SaaS platform streamlining business setup and payments in KSA.",
    "specialization": "A core part of my work is designing and implementing a fully compliant e-invoicing and payment service integrated with Xero, Marmin, and ZATCA — ensuring Saudi government regulations are met seamlessly. This includes automated billing workflows, real-time invoice tracking, and multi-channel payment processing via Checkout.com and Stripe.",
    "aiWork": "Additionally, I developed an OCR service leveraging Generative AI to extract structured data from documents — along with systems to track company compliance across multiple Saudi government portals.",
    "philosophy": "I enjoy solving messy real-world problems with structured systems — built to automate, scale, and save time."
